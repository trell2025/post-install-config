Triggers: Automate actions based on ticket conditions. For example, you can set up triggers to automatically assign tickets to specific agents, send email notifications, or update ticket status when certain conditions (like ticket priority or department) are met.

SLAs (Service Level Agreements): Define response and resolution times for different ticket priorities or departments. SLAs ensure that tickets are addressed within a specific timeframe, helping meet customer expectations and improving support efficiency.

Routing: Automatically assign tickets to the correct department or agent based on predefined criteria, such as the help topic or ticket type. This ensures tickets are efficiently directed to the right team for faster resolution.

<p>
the Customer Portal allows users to submit, track, and manage their support tickets. Customers can view the status of their tickets, update information, and communicate with support agents through the portal.

User Registration enables customers to create accounts, providing access to the portal where they can submit new tickets, check ticket history, and update personal details. Depending on configuration, users can either register and log in or submit tickets as guests without an account.

The portal enhances customer experience by offering self-service options and a central location for ticket management.
